Our original scheme was changed in the following ways:
- We deleted our scheduling tables (FollowSchedule and Schedule) and moved the start time, end time, and date values to the GymClass table
- We modified the tables to allow for delete functionality by including ON CASCADE and SET NULL, etc. upon deletion
