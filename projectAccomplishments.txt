Our project implemented a workout app that brings athletes, trainers, and admins together and allows for creation, viewing, and sign up of gyms, classes, routines, and exercises. We have 3 types of users: admins, trainers, and athletes. Each admin is assigned to a gym and manages classes, users, and keeps track of gym information. Trainers manage classes and exercises and would be responsible for teaching the classes that athletes attend in a real life scenario. Athletes can view and sign up for classes as well as view, work on, and create routines. All are able to record and update personal information. All three user types have a personal page, navigated to via an ID assigned at sign up. Each type of personal page has tabs that display and allow for management of that user's functionality.
